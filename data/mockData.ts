"This is a pivotal moment for our nation," he stated. "We are not just aiming for recovery; we are building a more resilient and inclusive economy for the future."</p><p>Business leaders have lauded the move, with the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) calling it "a step in the right direction." However, some economists have urged caution, highlighting the need for transparent implementation and monitoring to ensure the funds reach their intended beneficiaries and create a lasting impact.</p>',
